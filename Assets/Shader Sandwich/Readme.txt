Hi, welcome to Shader Sandwich! To get started I'd suggest taking a look at the online documentation here:http://www.electronic-mind.org/Pages/Things/SSDoc/Main.html
You can find a bunch of getting started tutorials along with an in-depth reference, enjoy!

I've also included offline copies of the first 3 tutorials, their in the Documentation folder.

If you have any questions or problems, feel free to email me at:
Ztechnologies.com@gmail.com

You can also report bugs or suggest features through the Help menu, in either Shader Sandwich (Help -> Report Bug or Suggest Feature!) or in the Unity Editor (Help -> Shader Sandwich -> Report Bug or Suggest Feature!).

Thanks, and have fun!
